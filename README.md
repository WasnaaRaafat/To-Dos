Hello there, I built a "To dos" React app using create-react-app and used React hooks and React query to implement CURD operations with a local jason server fake api endpoint, please run the application files on local host as well as watch the json-server db.json file locally using the terminal.

#### To run the web app use the following commands in the termnial

open a terminal and type the following command to start running the web app on local host:

`npm start`

#### for the _API_ endpoint to work open a second terminal on a different port and type the following command to start watching the file

`json-server --watch db.json`

After that the project should run normally on your local hosts using 2 different ports
