Hello there, I built a "To dos" React app using create-react-app, React hooks and React query to implement CURD operations with a local json server api endpoint, please run the application files on local host as well as watch the json-server db.json file locally using the terminal.

_Below are instructions on how to run the project_

#### To run the web app use the following commands in the terminal

open a terminal and type the following command to start running the web app on local host:

##### In the first terminal install the npm modules

`npm install`

##### then run the following command to start the react web application

`npm start`

#### for the _API_ endpoint to work open a second terminal on a different port and type the following commands to start watching the file

##### First install json-server to your node modules

`npm install -g json-server`

##### Then run the watch command to watch your json file

`json-server --watch db.json`

_When running the watch command you will be asked to use a different port, you can choose yes and the command will run normally_

##### After that the project should run normally on your local hosts using 2 different ports
